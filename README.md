# knitr-markdown-engines

This repository illustrates the basic usages of write scripts in either Rmarkdown or Knitr format with different engines (R, Bash, Python, Stan, C++), and compile them into pdfs.

**Note:**
1. It is hightly suggested to use Rmarkdown format to write the code;

**Todo:**
1. It seems that Knitr does not support inline running with other languages, such as C++ or Python, you need to compile the whole file.
2. The *Stan* code in rmarkdown is not colored.
