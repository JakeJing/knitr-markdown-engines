# knitr-markdown-engines

**Note:**

1. It is highly suggested to use Rmarkdown format to write the code;

**Todo:**
1. Learn to convert between R objects and other language objects.
2. It seems that **Knitr** does not support inline running with other languages, such as C++ or Python, you need to compile the whole file.
3. The *Stan* code in rmarkdown is not colored, probably due to the output.var.
