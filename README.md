# knitr-markdown-engines

This repository illustrates the basic usages of write scripts in either Rmarkdown or Knitr format with different engines (R, Bash, Python, Stan, C++), and compile them into pdfs.

**Note:**
- It is hightly suggested to use Rmarkdown format to write the code;

**Todo:**
- It seems that Knitr does not support inline running of other languages, such as C++ or Python, you need to compile the while file.
- The *Stan* code in rmarkdown is not colored.
